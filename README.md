# wrightFisherModel

It is a basic simulation of allelic evolution over generations using the Wright-Fisher Model. This particular code is agnostic of the mating pairs in the parental population
and extrapolates the allelic frequency from the previous generation. It uses this to generate a new allele population with some margin of error and subsequently pairs alleles
together randomly. 

This does not maintain either phenotypic or genotypic ratio strictly but it does maintain allelic frequency with some introduced error margin.
